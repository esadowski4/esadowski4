# Hi there, I'm Eric 👋

### Security Engineer Intern @ AWS | CS Student @ Purdue University

I am currently a sophomore in college with a passion for **Security Engineering**, **Distributed Systems**, and **Machine Learning**. I enjoy peeling back the layers of abstraction to understand how software interacts with hardware, from C and x86 Assembly up to large-scale distributed infrastructure.
